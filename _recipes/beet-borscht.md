image: beet-borscht.jpg

ingredients:
    - 1 large cabbage red/green
    - 12 cups beef/vegetable/chicken broth, any broth will work
    - 1 large onion
    - 3 medium carrots
    - olive oil (healthy)/sunflower oil(authentic)
    - 4 large potatoes
    - 6 oz can tomato paste
    - salt (to taste)
    - 3 bay leaves (or more, depends on slav you are)
    - 1 tbsp white vinegar
    - Pinch of sugar / maple syrup
    - 3 garlic cloves (or more, see above)
    - black pepper (to taste)
    - 1/4 cup dill or parsley or both
    - sour cream (sub yogurt)
    - (Optional) MSG (Use a lot more than you think you should)
    - (OPtional) Sour Dough/Rye toast
    - (Optional) Kielbasa Sausage/beans/beef any protein

directions:
    - Get your broth heating up in the pot you want a low boil, add your bay leaves in.
    - While waiting prep the veggies
    - Shred the cabbage
    - Dice/shred the onion (I prefer shredded gives it a nice texture)
    - Dice/shred carrots (^)
    - Matchstick the beets.
    - Cube potatoes (Can be peeled or unpeeled, I prefer unpeeled)
    - Once broth is boiling, add cabbage cover bring to a boil then reduce to low heat to cook for about 20 minutes
    - While that is happening you are going to saute the other veggies.
    - Add your oil get it up to about medium heat, add your onions and carrots, saute until the onions just start to brown, go ahead and throw that in the pot.
    - Add your matchsticked beets and repeat the process, it's hard to tell when they've browned just try and dry them out a bit, don't fret the red will come off the pan with a bit of scrubbing, once done toss them in the pot
    - At this point add your potatoes, tomato paste, mix it up then salt to taste, remember you want it a touch salty to compesate for the potatoes, and beets which will just suck up the salt, cook for about 20 minutes on low heat
    - While that is cooking it's time to get your protein ready, I generally opt for kielbasa
    - Cut your kielbasa into small about 2 cm thick medallions.
    - put just a touch of oil in your pan, heat it up, fry the kielbasa until it just starts to get some good black bits.
    - Add kielbasa to pot, turn off the heat.
    - Add vinegar, sugar, garlic, pepper, and the main ingredient MSG.
    - Let it sit for about 10 minutes for the flavors to marry.
    - Add dill, and adjust any seasonings.

body: The way I like to serve it, toast your sourdough, scrape a clove of garlic all over the bread, spread sour cream over the bread sprinkle with a generous amount of dill. The throw a big dollop of sour cream into the borscht, and once again sprinkle a generous amount of dill on top. I like to dip the bread in the borscht. Something I quite like that I read is a traditional way of eating borscht in Ukraine is to take a small bite of the garlic clove between bites of borscht it's quite good. Enjoy feel free to stir the sour cream into the soup or not it's up to you.
